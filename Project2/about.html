            <strong>
                <p>Why does the switch not fit in my keyboard?</p>
            </strong>

            <p>This will most likely depend on the number of pins your keyboard supports. Switches either have 3
                or 5 pins and if your
                keyboard supports only 3-pin, the 5-pin switch will not fit without a simple modification (link
                to tutorial).</p>

        </article>
        <article class="question">
            <strong>
                <p>Why does my keyboard not register the key press after installing the switch?</p>
            </strong>

            <p>You most likely bent a pin while installing the switch onto the keyboard. This is very common and all
                you need to do is remove the switch, straighten the pin out with pliers and install the switch again
                (link to
                tutorial).</p>

        </article>
        <article class="question">
            <strong>
                <p>My switches came with a bent pin, what do I do?</p>
            </strong>

            <p>We try our best to visually inspect every single switch during the packing process but it is possible
                that a switch gets
                bent during shipping. This is a very easy fix and should not cause any long term damage to the
                performance (link to
                tutorial).</p>

        <h3>shipping</h3>
        <article class="question">
            <strong>
                <p>Do you ship internationally?</p>
            </strong>

            <p>Yes! We ship to customers around the globe and offer free international shipping for order $249 USD
                or
                more.</p>

        </article>
        <article class="question">
            <strong>
                <p>How long does it take my products to ship?</p>
            </strong>
            <p>We know how important it is to get you typing as soon as possible. Most orders have a 24 hour turn
                around
                time but keep
                in mind that the free standard shipping can take anywhere from 2 - 5 days.</p>

    <h3>Tracking</h3>
    <article class="question">
        <strong>
            <p>My tracking says the package was delivered but I'm not able to find it. What do I do?</p>
        </strong>

        <p>In these situations we recommend the following:

            Check with neighbors to see if the package was left with them by mistake.
            Wait a couple more days to see is USPS will deliver late.
            Contact your local post office and ask them to follow up with the package. Priority mail includes a
            $100
            insurance
            coverage.</p>

    </article>

    <article class="question">
        <strong>
            <p>I don't like the switches I bought after I installed them on my keyboard and trying them out, can I
                return them?</p>
        </strong>

        <p>No, sorry but we do not accept returns unless there was an issue with your order and we were at fault
            (i.e. you were
            sent the wrong switches). We recommend doing your research before committing to any particular
            switch or
            buying a tester
            pack.</p>
